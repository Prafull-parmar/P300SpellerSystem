# P300 Speller System For Brain Computer Interface (BCI)
## Description
* The P300 Speller System for Brain Computer Interface has an objective of effectively communicating with patients having motor neuron diseases. 
* The system makes use of the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals recorded from the scalp, as the patient responds to some visual stimuli.
* A rare visual event leads to an event-related potential (ERP), which is detected in the electroencephalogram after approximately 300 ms as per the oddball paradigm.
* The recorded data is then used to train a classifier for predicting the sequence of characters that the patient wants to convey.
* Such a system would act as a potent manner of expression for the suffering patients.
